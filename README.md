# UFO



## Purpose of Project

The project has been created to allow Dana to perform an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by being able to filter for various attributes of the sighting to review the sightings in an easier manner

## Results

### How to use:

The webpage shows a search bar per the image below, each parameter and how to use is described below

#### Date

Date is formatted as month/day/year and goes for the first 13 days of January 2010. To filer you can type in the date youâ€™d like to see, hit enter and the list will remove the other dates

#### City

City is formatted as the city name, when typing the city name in the filter will need exact spelling and civilization, city names are all in lowercase. Type in the city you'd like to see, hit enter and the table will filter

#### State

States are formatted with their two-digit abbreviations, also lower case. Type in the state you'd like to see and hit enter and the table will filter

#### Country

Country is formatted with to lowercase letter abbreviations; this dataset is all from the us meaning this filter will include all data sets.

#### Shape

There are various shapes of the UFOs (circle, light, triangle etc.). This is all typed in lowercase, type in the shape you'd like to see, hit enter and the table will filter.


## Summary

### Design Drawbacks

The website is driven off all 2010 data from the us - to improve the site we could add in a live feed which has more up to date information from a broader range of countries. We could also add a heatmap within the website to show where these sightings are from and if there are higher concentrations in particular locations.

### Further Development

To further improve the website the below is recommended:

- Adding drop down options so when filtering the individual can see the various options, they must pick from rather than requiring them to type
- Selecting country first and enabling it so when the country is selected it relates to state by only showing states within that country
